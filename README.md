2D Collisions
===

Basic 2D collisions using the SAT theorem.

## Notes

The code can still be optimized, I also plan adding some figures that come handly in 2D like lines and circles.

##Dependencies

* [https://github.com/g-truc/glm](glm)

##Building

In order to build the example you'll need [https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML](SFML) because the example use it for displaying figures on a window.

Once you have SFML just do
```
./configure
make run
```
